[Microbial Biogeography: Is Everything Small Everywhere?](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=-hZcLy3RWckC&oi=fnd&pg=PA87&dq=biogeography+bacteriophage&ots=74MAR3eTeb&sig=ydhAnx9SSELkr3u9S5eP7XEyM2g#v=onepage&q=biogeography%20bacteriophage&f=false)

This is a chapter in the book Microbial Ecological Theory: Current Perspectives by Lesley A. Ogilvie.

Originally people thought everything was everywhere because of the small size and dispersability of microbes (among other reasons), but recent studies have challenged this idea, providing evidence for spatial patterns at various scales and that biogeographical processes affect microorgansisms as well as macro organisms.
